Galileo The company had already begun installing Galileo-enabled receivers aboard all of its 5000 high-speed trains (TGV) with the immediate goal of providing enhanced passenger services (real-time, precise train location information to those onboard and those waiting at stations down the line) and the eventual goal of autonomous operation. “Some 320 trains are expected to be Galileo-ready by the end of 2019,” said Antoine Barre, head of train localization projects at SNCF.
